  In general.., as the application becomes complex you will have more than one view in 
  the application. 
  Let's say you are building a single page application for a training institute and you have the following views
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Courses</li>
  <li>Students</li>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
